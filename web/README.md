# git fit web

This directory contains a minimal client-side scaffold for a React app.
It is intentionally minimal and contains placeholders only so you can inspect the project structure.

To enable the full dev flow, add the dependencies (see package.json) and optionally Tailwind/plugins.

Quick check (from repo root):

  cd web
  npm install
  npm run dev

Note: The scaffold does not perform compression or upload; implement a backend API and wire the UI to it if you want full functionality.
