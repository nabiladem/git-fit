# git fit

As a GitHub user, perhaps you have tried to change your GitHub avatar and realized there is a 1MB limit for images you can upload. Git Fit's purpose is to provide a tool in your command line interface (CLI) to compress your avatar of choice while maintaining high quality.

> NOTE!
> GitHub does not allow updating avatars through the GitHub API. GitHub avatars are generated and hosted from Gravatar (https://gravatar.com). The only other option is to use their API.

- [ ] **TO DO: Connect to Gravatar API to update avatars.**
